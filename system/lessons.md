# Lessons Learned

## Phase 0 Observations

1. **Existing code is monolithic** — The scraper_pro/ codebase is a single-app scraper with no platform architecture. Refactoring into shared core + multiple runtime shells will require significant restructuring.

2. **Reusable components identified** — proxy_manager.py, AI extraction logic, smart_exporter.py, verticals/templates system, and core/fallback_chain.py contain valuable logic that should be preserved and refactored into shared packages.

3. **API key embedded in code** — README mentions Gemini API key is "embedded in code" — this is a security issue that must be fixed early (move to environment variables / secrets management).

4. **No test infrastructure** — Tests exist but are ad-hoc scripts, not structured test suites. Need proper pytest setup with fixtures and CI integration.
